# HIV-1_DR_RJ_Analysis: HIV-1 Drug Resistance Reporting from JSON files

## Overview
This tool was created in collaboration with sequencing staff (James McKenna, Lesley Neill, Derek Fairley, Tanya Curran) at the Regional Virology Laboratory, Belfast to produce bespoke HIV-1 drug resistant clinical reports containing both patient information and Stanford's University HIV-1 resistance database [HIVdb](https://hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb/by-reads/) interpretation to help our clinicians in patient management of HIV-1 infection.

It uses the 'raw JSON report' outputs which can be downloaded from [HIVdb](https://hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb/by-reads/) following submission of raw FASTQs to the HIVdb-NGS pipeline.
