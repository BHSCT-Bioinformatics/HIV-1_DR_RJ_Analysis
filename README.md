# HIV-1_DR_RJ_Analysis: HIV-1 Drug Resistance Reporting from JSON files

## Overview
This tool was created in collaboration with sequencing staff (James McKenna, Lesley Neill, Derek Fairley, Tanya Curran) at the BHSCT Regional Virology Laboratory, Belfast, to produce bespoke HIV-1 drug resistant clinical reports containing both patient information and Stanford's University HIV-1 resistance database [HIVdb](https://hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb/by-reads/) interpretation to help our clinicians in patient management of HIV-1 infection.

Although 'raw JSON report' outputs are available following submission of paired FASTQs to the HIVdb-NGS pipeline, these are not in a user friendly format for our clinical colleagues. Therefore using an overarching R script `HIV_resistance_report_online_only.R`(overview below), different bespoke clinical reports (created by `R Markdown` scripts) are generated based on the suffix following the lab number.
